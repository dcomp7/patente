## 🎯 Summary

With a background in Law and Computer Science, I have always been curious about intellectual property. In 2019, I drafted and filed this patent with INPI Brazil aiming to launch a new venture, a project that did not materialize. I chose not to renew the registration in 2022, placing the patent in the public domain. This repository brings together the original document and the main lessons learned from that journey.

## 💡 Lessons learned

### The dilemma for technology companies

Many tech companies choose not to patent their core innovations to avoid disclosing details that could facilitate copying. In some cases, trade secrets offer more effective protection than patents. Each case is different—sometimes it is worth it and sometimes it is not.

### Value far beyond the document itself

Just as scientific papers have a technical-academic nature, patents have a technical-legal nature—but they go far beyond protection against competitors. A patent transcends the technical-legal aspect in areas such as:

- **Market signaling**: Demonstrates capacity for innovation, methodological rigor, and strategic vision
- **Commercial argument**: A way to differentiate from competitors
- **Opens doors**: Will be read by potential clients, suppliers, investors, etc.
- **Intangible asset**: Adds value to the company
- **Positioning**: Reveals how the organization thinks, acts, and investigates complex problems

### The importance of technical review

Always consider: whom would you want as a witness in potential litigation? Always submit your patents for review by respected specialists such as PhDs, senior engineers, and recognized researchers.

This patent, for example, was reviewed by two PhDs, an executive, and two industry engineers.
